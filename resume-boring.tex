\subsection*{Hands-on Coding Expertise}

\subsection*{As an architect, I have been responsible for}

Generation and analysis of \href{https://www.openapis.org/}{OpenApi} REST interfaces and MQ for transparency of service communication.
\newline - Idempotency of all requests with request inbox pattern. As a result: POST always 200 and edit lock if 500 like in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html#client-tokens}{AWS client token} and \href{https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests}{Stripe Idempotency-Key}. Versioned or fingerprinted GET like in \href{https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/setTags}{Google Cloud}. \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2549839/are-soft-deletes-a-good-idea}{Soft DELETE} with 200 in short time window.
\newline - Integration events idempotency from "at least once delivery" to "at most once delivery" with transaction outbox pattern.

Security audit.

 - to prevent forgery of entries in the database with \href{https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27432/what-is-nonce-in-ethereum-how-does-it-prevent-double-spending}{nonce}.
\newline - to prevent forgery of entries from external services with \href{https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/digital-signatures}{digital signatures} with \href{https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/security/digital-signing-asymmetric-keys-aws-kms/}{AWS KMS} and \href{https://www.vaultproject.io/}{Vault}.
\newline - Hiding sensitive data with \href{https://www.pragmaticcoders.com/blog/anonymous-transactions-on-the-public-blockchain}{hash-based} exchange and etc.

I have been responsible at least twice for:

 - Making architectural decisions at project initiation (how to split domains, how to add strict borders) 
\newline - Providing \href{https://plantuml.com/ru/}{plant-uml} architecture diagrams for the resulting solution. I use \href{https://www.eventstorming.com/}{event storming} in my practice for \href{https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/_open_agile_architecture.html}{incremental architecture}. All my decisions are based on solutions already used in the company, so I shouldn't care a lot about the cost of infrastructure.

As a front-end architect, I was responsible for:

 - compliance with the boundaries of reuse of packages between domains
\newline - reducing the number of open connections to the backend
\newline - first page load time
\newline - offline support
\newline - accessibility and semantic core
\newline - legacy browsers support
\newline - css methodology and its performance characteristics

\end{samepage}

\subsection*{As a Scrum Master, I have been responsible for}

 - stand-ups always plan tasks for the day
\newline - retrospectives always end with the creation of tasks in the backlog
\newline - planning always ends with evaluations, where 1 task equals 1 story point equals one acceptance test
\newline - demo is always prepared between code review and task completion.

\subsection*{Some Recent Projects}

\subsection*{Code mentoring and consulting}

2021 - I was a code mentor to Senior Frontend Developer in one of the largest \href{https://pinkman.ru/}{design studios} in Russia. I helped him get an offer for a leading position in just a few days of pair programming.
\newline - Vue, Nuxt, Typescript

2020 - Provision of consulting services for writing a small back-end for a mobile document management application.
\newline - Nest.js, MongoDB, Typescript

\end{samepage}

\subsection*{Some Recent Projects}

2022--. \href{https://currency.com/}{\textbf{Currency.com/Capital.com API}}: Exchange with the \href{https://financefeeds.com/who-won-the-forexbrokers-com-2023-annual-awards/}{fastest growth in 2023}. My contribution to the success of the company is the integration (transaction processing and security) of popular blockchain projects: \href{https://currency.com/ecash-xec-price-prediction}{XEC}, \href{https://currency.com/fantom-ftm-news-price-analysis}{Fantom}, \href{https://currency.com/what-is-vechain-your-ultimate-guide}{VeChain}, \href{https://currency.com/eth-2-0-what-s-happened-so-far-and-when-is-the-next-phase}{Ethereum 2.0}. And most importantly - architecture of \href{https://github.com/vechain/connex}{VeChain}, \href{https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs}{Cosmos}, \href{https://github.com/polkadot-js/api}{Polkadot}, \href{https://github.com/tronprotocol/tronweb}{Tron} and \href{https://github.com/Zilliqa/zilliqa-js}{Zilliqa} processing. Namely, a \href{https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html}{microservice} \href{https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/distilling-domain/}{domain-oriented} \href{https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html}{fault-tolerant} architecture.

2022--. \href{https://currency.com/}{\textbf{Currency.com/Capital.com DLK/UMS}}: Bank System with transaction processing, user data management, accounting and etc. My personal contribution to this product is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer}{KYC AML/CFT} tools integration: \href{https://demo.chainalysis.com/request-a-demo/}{Chainalysis}, \href{https://crystalblockchain.com/}{Cystal} and \href{https://www.coinfirm.com/}{Coinfirm}. Without which it would be impossible to make transactions.

2018--2022 \href{https://vtargete.ru/}{\textbf{vTargete.ru}}: Ads management data grid 
with time travel features like \href{https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/}{in figma}, 
batch updates, 
task scheduler with \href{https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/}{drag and drop} predicate builder and \href{https://simonwep.github.io/selection/}{selectable} timetable, 
excel-like  \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/calculation-formula}{cell computing} with \href{https://prosemirror.net/}{prosemirror} and \href{https://mathjs.org/}{mathjs} formula editor, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type}{crdt}, \href{https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ru//pubs/archive/35605.pdf}{differential synchronization} and shared worker sync. The closest analogue is the \href{https://www.airtable.com/}{Airtable}.

2018--2019. \href{https://baltinfocom.ru/BigData\#en}{\textbf{Graph Visualization Library}}: Is a Typescript library for large-scale interactive graph visualizations. Its graphical engine is built for \href{https://threejs.org/}{Three.js} first, and some hard parts with \href{https://webglfundamentals.org/}{WebGL}. It use SVG for labels with css formating, and html for some provided controls like context menu. It offers all features required to display, explore, and interact with graph data - graph search, collapsing nodes, smart layouts with \href{https://github.com/d3/d3-force}{d3} and custom, and too many algorithms on graphs. The most difficult feature that I did was probably export the graph as pictures weighing more than 3 GB. Although optimizations with \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer}{SharedArrayBuffer} were also not easy. \href{https://github.com/greggman}{Greggman} helped me a lot, and \href{https://webglfundamentals.org/}{I translated his lessons} into Russian. The closest analogue is the \href{https://doc.linkurio.us/ogma/latest/}{Ogma}.

2018--2019. \href{https://baltinfocom.ru/BigData\#en}{\textbf{Octopus / Universal Data Analysis Platform}}: Open Source Intelligence. Oh, I'm not sure what is legal to write about this.
The closest analogue is the \href{https://www.palantir.com/}{Palantir} or may be  \href{https://linkurio.us/}{Linkurious}.
In this company, I was also involved in the finalization of the \href{https://github.com/NikitaIT/facebook-crawling-nightmare}{Facebook crawler}.

2017--2018. \textbf{Custom CRM/BPMS/CMS (back-office)}: 
Domain driven design, LEARN(Agile), 1M+ LOC. I interacted with all employees of the company, different departments. I followed how they worked to make this product comfortable and automate everything possible. And I worked in a team with the same adepts of clean code as me. We, as developers, also cared about security, not just AppSec. Once a thief was identified by ip. The closest analogue does not exist.
